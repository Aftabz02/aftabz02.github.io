# TechAlive static site

These are ready-to-upload files for GitHub Pages.

- Ensure your repository is named `techalive.co.uk` or enable Pages in repo settings.
- Keep **index.html** at the root (not index.htm).
- Put the `CNAME` file at the root (already included).
- Commit and push the `assets/` folder and all HTML/CSS files.

## Structure
```
/
  index.html
  services.html
  about.html
  faq.html
  booking.html
  style.css
  CNAME
  assets/
    img/  (site images)
```

## Notes
- Update email/phone in `booking.html` as needed.
- Replace images in `assets/img` with your own later if you wish.
- All links are absolute from root (e.g. `/services.html`) to avoid broken paths.
